Hi, I'm **Samuel Tagliacozzo**, a university student at Tor Vergata in the Faculty of Computer Science.

I'm trying to get into the world of computer science as best I can, not just coding or computer engineering. I aspire to become a Full-Stack Developer, to be able to generally adapt to any future project.

I'm currently trying to master Python, which although it's not very suitable for every area, but it seems like a good start.
