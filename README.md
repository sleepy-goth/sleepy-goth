Hi, I'm **Samuel Tagliacozzo**, a university student at Tor Vergata in the Faculty of Computer Science.

I am currently trying to enter the world of IT and programming to aim for a future at Full-Stack Developing.

I'm very interested in Javascript and Typescript with the vast variety of frameworks that concern them for the development of Web Apps and Mobile Apps but I'm also trying to deal with the back-end via Python for now.

I'm starting to embrace the philosophy of Open Source Software and the use of Linux systems for work and hosting.
